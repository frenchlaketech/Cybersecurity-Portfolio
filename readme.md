# About Me 
  Hello, my name is Hal. As an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst, the three strengths that I have are resilience, high level of communication, and extensive technical knowledge in hardware.  My keen attention to detail would be an asset in shielding users from cyber threats and ensuring that internet security for organizations and end-users.  The thing that interests me the most about cybersecurity is becoming an ethical hacker and working with a wide range of software and tool sets.  When someone hears the word “hacker” they’re always thinking of the guys in Blackhats who have the intent of scamming and looking for profits through illegal measures.  But that stigma is far from the truth and the perspective is more towards the aims of security and business operations.  With my resilience, strong written and verbal communication and the knowledge that I have in technical hardware I can help teach users safer ways to protect themselves and our organization from cyber threats that are out there today.
